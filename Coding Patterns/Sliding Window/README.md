# Sliding Window

## Sliding Window pattern which is very useful to solve problems in which you are asked to find the longest/shortest string, subarray, or a desired value which you need to calculate from subarrays.

```
How to identify?
So we want to be able to identify the problems that sliding window pattern works.

- The problem involves a data structure that is ordered and iterable like arrays, strings, etc.
- The problem is asking to find a subrange in an array/string, contiguous longest, shortest, average or target value.
- There is an apparent naive or brute force solution that runs in O(N2), O(2N) or some other large time complexity.
- The amazing thing about sliding window problems is that most of the time they can be solved in O(N) time and O(1) space complexity.

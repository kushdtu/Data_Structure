# Fast & Slow Pointers

## By moving at different speeds, the algorithm proves that the two pointers are going to meet eventually. The fast pointer should catch the slow pointer once both the pointers are in a cyclic loop.

How to identify?
This approach is quite useful when dealing with cyclic Linked Lists or Arrays.

When the problem involves something related to cyclic data structures, you should think about Fast & Slow Pointers pattern.

# Two Pointers

## Two Pointers pattern which is very useful to solve problems with sorted arrays (or Linked Lists) which involve a set of pair elements, or a triplet or even a subarray.

```
How to identify?
So we want to be able to identify the problems that Two Pointers pattern works.

- The problem involve sorted arrays (or Linked Lists), a set of pair elements, or a triplet or even a subarray.
- There is a target value to match or duplicates to be removed.
- Most of these type of problems can be solved in O(N) time complexity and O(1) or O(N) space complexity.
